title: Understanding Hodgson's "Islamicate"
---
Based on Hodgson's Venture of Islam volumes, the term "Islamicate" is a neologism introduced by Marshall G. S. Hodgson to address a significant ambiguity in the study of Islamic civilization. The term serves to distinguish the cultural and social complex historically associated with Islam and the Muslims from the religion of Islam itself.

Hodgson argues that the terms "Islam" and "Islamic" have been used too casually in modern scholarship, often referring ambiguously to both the religion and the broader society and culture. While it is difficult, perhaps even undesirable, to draw a completely sharp line between religion and other aspects of life, using a single term for both can be misleading. Much of what has been done as part of the historical "Islamic" civilization can even be characterized as "un-Islamic" in the religious sense of the word.

To clarify this, Hodgson proposes using "Islam" (capitalized) to refer specifically to the religion in its historical sense, stemming from the personal act of _islam_ (submission to God). The adjective "Islamic" is then restricted to things "of or pertaining to" Islam in this proper, religious sense. For example, "Islamic literature" in this restricted sense refers only to more or less religious literature, not all literature produced in the relevant society. Similarly, "Islamic art" implies a distinction, such as mosque architecture versus illustrations in a medical handbook, even though a sharp boundary may not exist.

However, there was no widely accepted adjective to describe the broader social and cultural complex of the society in which Islam was prevalent. This is where "Islamicate" comes in. Hodgson uses the term "Islamdom" (analogous to "Christendom") to refer to the society itself â€“ a complex of social relations where Muslims and their faith were prevalent and socially dominant, including non-Muslims as an integral, though subordinate, element. "Islamdom" is the society that carries the culture, but it is not the civilization itself.

The "Islamicate" then refers to the _culture_ developed within "Islamdom". It is a culture centered on a lettered tradition, historically distinctive of Islamdom society, and naturally shared by both Muslims and non-Muslims who fully participate in that society.

Hodgson explains the coinage of "Islamicate" by analogy with "Italianate," which refers to things "in the Italian style" rather than directly to Italy or everything Italian. Similarly, "Islamicate" refers to the social and cultural complex historically associated with Islam and Muslims, found among both Muslims and non-Muslims, rather than directly to the religion Islam itself. The "-icate" ending is added to avoid the common ambiguity of "Islamic".

The distinction between "Islamic" (religious) and "Islamicate" (cultural/social) is deemed essential for clear and accurate scholarship, as confusing the two has led scholars into error. For instance, when discussing law, "Islamic law" might mean the religious Shari'ah, whereas law as a dimension of cultural life within the Islamicate civilization would include non-Shar'i legal patterns. Without distinct terms, non-Shar'i law is often overlooked, creating a false balance.

Examples of things that fall under the "Islamicate" umbrella include:

- The culture expressed in various languages derived from the Arabic alphabet, such as Arabic, Persian, Ottoman Turkish, and Urdu.
- Technical terms common across this culture, often derived from Arabic or Persian.
- Common names and customary practices like dating methods or letter headings.
- Philosophy (Falsafah), including natural and moral science, based on the Greek tradition, which flourished within the Islamicate society.
- Literature and art when considered as aspects of the civilization at large, not restricted to religious themes.
- Science.
- The broader cultural traditions distinctively associated with Islamdom.

The "Islamicate" civilization developed over several historical periods described in the source, including the High Caliphal Period (c. 692-945), characterized as "the first period of Islamicate civilization proper," marked by a dominant Arabic language for science and culture and a synthesis of lettered traditions. It later expanded into an international civilization utilizing both Arabic and Persian as major languages. The Later Middle Period (c. 1258-1503) is highlighted as a time when features specific to Islamdom and its Islamicate traits might become clearer, with outstanding figures of Islamicate civilization active during this time.

Using the term "Islamicate" is preferred over alternatives like "Perso-Arabic civilization" because of the pre-eminent role played by Islam and Muslims, but the added "-icate" ending helps signify that it is not simply the religious sphere. Furthermore, using "Arabic" as a term for the civilization is considered inaccurate and misleading, as important cultural figures wrote in other languages like Persian, and such usage reinforces false preconceptions.

In summary, "Islamicate" is a specific scholarly term used in this work to designate the broad social and cultural patterns historically associated with Islam and the society of Islamdom, distinguishing these phenomena from the religion of Islam itself.
