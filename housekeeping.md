This note may prove particularly useful for readers interested in how this site publishes its notes.

This site is effectively a [personal knowledge base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_base) (PKB) on Islamic studies based upon a private local [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault. By utilizing the concept of [[06 Published/Notes/Atomic Notes|atomic notes]] with [backlinking](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Backlinks) and [tagging](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Tags), when all else works in cohesion, should provide deeper connections and quicker access to the broader concepts covered in this PKB. This thesis can only be proven through the test of time. Hence, at the outset of the project, notes may be completely incoherent or otherwise disjointed.

Generally, this space avoids using transliteration whenever possible since the effort of the busywork involved doesnâ€™t justify the value, especially given the volume of notes inteded to be published over time. However, should transliteration be used on some selecte notes the [Brill Arabic-English transliteration system](https://referenceworks.brillonline.com/pages/help/transliteration-islam) will be used.

In terms of Quran translation, [The Glorious Quran (Irfan-ul-Quran)](https://www.irfan-ul-quran.com/) is primarily used. It is accessible and coherent, making it suitable for a wide audience. Maintaining single, well-regarded translation aids in consistency throughout the site.

All typefaces are sourced via [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

Below are the colour theme schemes used on this site.
