# The Nobility of Knowledge and its Divine Connection

## Knowledge as a Path to Divine Connection

The lecture stresses the profound nobility of knowledge, drawing from Islamic teachings:

- **Angelic Support:** The angels "involve their wings" for those seeking knowledge, as mentioned in a Hadith.
- **Divine Witness:** Allah (subḥānahu wa ta'āla) bears witness to His unity, alongside angels and people of knowledge. Murad quotes the Qur'anic verse: "Shahid Allahu an la ilaha illa Huwa, wal mala'ikatu wa ulul 'ilmi qa'iman bil qist". This translates to: "Allah bears witness that there is no deity except Him, and the angels, and those endowed with knowledge, upholding justice".
    - This verse categorizes three entities that bear witness to Divine Unity through "mental cognition, knowledge, perfection": Allah Himself, the angels, and people of knowledge.
    - Every other part of creation bears witness to divine unity simply "by being," as "āyāt" (signs). However, human beings, with their capacity to speak, can articulate this witness, making the "Shahādah" (declaration of faith). Murad suggests that whatever a student studies should be viewed as "embroidering upon that Shahāda and making it more evident".
- **Elevation of Status:** The Quran highlights the elevated status of those with knowledge, stating: "Yarfa' Allahulladhīna āmanū minkum walladhīna ūtul 'ilma darajāt". This means: "Allah raises those who believe among you, and those who have been given knowledge, by degrees". This emphasis on knowledge and its nobility is considered a special feature of Islam and the Quran.

## The Unity of Knowledge: Sacred and Profane

A fundamental concept is the rejection of any "distinction between the sacred and the profane, the holy and the secular".

- **Universal Submission:** Murad references a principle, possibly alluding to "Kullu shayin yusabbihu bihamdihi" (Everything glorifies Him with His praise) or "Kullu shay’in yakhda’u lahu" (Everything is submissive to Him), stating that "everything is submissive to him, obeys him, bears witness to his beauty and his majesty". There is "nothing that is not a perfect sign if you know how to read".
- **The "Kitāb al-khuluq" (Book of Creation):** With the right intention, learning allows one to "read a little bit better" the "kitāb al-khuluq" (Book of Creation).
    - A medic, for instance, learns to see "amazing things about creation" through their studies.
    - An engineer observes "amazing things about the laws of creation" through equations and calculations.
    - Ultimately, it is "a matter of the cognitive frame with which you perceive the kitāb al-khuluq that you're studying".

# Ten Essential Duties of the Student

Murad then presents a list of ten "waẓā’if" (duties) or "ādāb" (options/duties) for students, which are "nine hundred years old but I think are still really useful to ourselves". While the original context for these principles primarily concerned "sacred knowledge," they are applicable to "whatever legitimate thing it is we're studying" today.

## Duty 1: Purity of Soul (Tahārat al-Nafs)

- **Purity of Heart and Nerves:** A student should begin their studies with "purity of soul, the heart and nerves". This means avoiding "a mass of conflicting intentions and insecurities and anxieties and questions as a kind of mass of confusion".
- **Right Intention ("Niyyah"):** The intention ("Niyyah") should be clear: "to serve Allah through serving humanity in that dīn [religion/hereafter] and in that dunya [worldly life]".
- **Self-Awareness:** This intention is "predicated on knowledge of the self"; one must possess "some self awareness" before being fully aware of anything else.

## Duty 2: Reducing Attachment to Worldly Life (Dunya)

- **Austere Existence:** Students should use their studies as a means to "reduce their attachments to dunya" (worldly life). Murad acknowledges that student life, often involving "tiny cells which students have to occupy" and travel away from home comforts, can already be "an austere existence".
- **Thought-Provoking Environment:** This "strange, unsettling, thought-provoking, less dunya kind of environment" can be intentionally shaped to reduce reliance on "dunya" and increase concentration on the "akhira" (hereafter).

## Duty 3: Humility (Tawādu')

- **Respect for Teachers:** A key aspect of humility is "respect for one's teachers".
- **No Outsmarting:** Students should not "try to outsmart your teacher," even if they believe the teacher is incorrect on a particular issue. Proper conduct ("adab") dictates that one might "maybe even indicate to the teacher afterwards," but only "as long as nobody is actively misled".

## Duty 4: Avoiding Premature Engagement with Controversial Issues

- **For Beginners:** If a student is a beginner, they should "don't gratify your ego by diving into controversial issues".
- **Understanding First:** The priority is to "understand what the teacher is saying correctly first of all".
- **Seeking Knowledgeable Explanations:** When exploring different views, even in the sciences, students should "find a teacher or a lecturer who knows those different views and can explain them rather than just list them," as this will be more beneficial.

## Duty 5: Avoiding Over-Specialization

- **Broad Knowledge:** Students should "not over specialize but know at least the outline of every discipline".
- **All-Round Education:** Murad notes the modern tendency to over-specialize, citing the example of "the engineer will know for a bridge Shakespeare or doesn't know anything about law". He emphasizes the need for "an all-round type of Education".

## Duty 6: Focusing on What is Truly Important

- **Prioritize Key Points:** A student "should recognize what's really important and focus on that".
- **Avoid Distractions:** When reading a book or listening to a lecture, one must be "aware of the really important takeaways and the key points that are being paid," and "don't be distracted by things that are subsidiary".

## Duty 7: Being Methodical

- **Thorough Understanding:** When something is learned, students must "make sure you've really understood it before you move on to studying the next thing".
- **Mastering Concepts:** The advice is simple but crucial: "don't turn the page until you've understood what's on that page".

## Duty 8: Valuing Knowledge by its Outcomes, Not Just Proofs

- **Outcomes over Proofs:** Knowledge is noble "because of its outcomes not because of the strength of the proofs".
- **Medicine vs. Mathematics Example:** Murad provocatively states that "medicine is a nobler science than mathematics even though these proofs are weaker".
    - **Medicine's Benefits:** Medicine is nobler because "it enhances very obvious aspects of human well-being and can take babies and prolong life and cure fevers and so forth because of its outcomes".
    - **Mathematics' Abstraction:** In contrast, a discipline "that is just about working out equations even though that which is strictly a purely scientific and mathematical might have stronger proofs, it's a less noble discipline" due to its less direct human benefit. The nobility of a science is tied to its "manfa'ah" (benefit) to humanity.

## Duty 9: The Right Intention (Niyyah) for Personal Development

- **Holistic Integration:** The intention ("Niyyah") for seeking knowledge must be "to properly integrate... into the holistic reality of your Muslim existence".
- **Becoming a Better Person:** The ultimate goal is "to become a better person," a "person of greater faḍl" (excellence or virtue), rather than merely "to get a job or to be able to press a button and then suddenly you become a GP in the local surgery".

## Duty 10: Understanding the Purpose and Religious Relation of Each Discipline

- **Purpose of Discipline:** It is an "obligation to know how each thing you learn relates to the purpose of that discipline".
- **Practical Good and Religious Connection:** Students should "know what good it can be" and "ultimately know how it relates to religion". Even if the connection seems "rather tenuous," things "useful for mankind that have a general naf'" (benefit) can be connected.
    - **Examples of Beneficence:** Studying law can be for "saving people from being deported for instance or to save people from the gallows". Medicine saves lives, and engineering helps people.
- **Supporting One's Faith:** While these disciplines "can be abused," they "can also be used". It is crucial for the student "to be clear about how this relates to your dīn and how your dīn is going to be supported rather than challenged by this other thing that's developing in your life".

# Conclusion

These ten principles cuts "through to the heart of the matter". The encouragement is to check our intentions and see if we can be noble for sometimes apparently worldly things that we're studying.
