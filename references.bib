(51:56) The Companion 'Abdullah Ibn 'Abbas, the preeminent exegete for whom the Prophet Muhammad prayed "O Allah, teach him the interpretation of the Scripture," said about this verse, "Except to worship me means: Except to know Me." To endeavor to know Allah is to fulfill the very purpose of our existence, and to know Him is to know His beautiful names, attributes, and acts. In this work, taken from his large exegesis of Sura al-Fatiha, Ibn Ajiba details the meanings of Allah's Ninety-Nine Beautiful Names (al-Asma' al-Husna) and shows readers how to come closer to Allah through the three-fold path of connection, inculcation, and realization: to connect to each of the divine names; to inculcate their meanings in ethics and character; and to attain realization of them, beyond repetition, rote memory, or theoretical discussion. In this commentary, readers can get a glimpse of the transformative power of knowing the Creator through His Ninety-Nine Beautiful Names, about which the Prophet Muhammad has said, "To Allah belongs ninety-nine names; whosoever enumerates them fully shall enter the Garden." (al-Bukhari)"--Page 4 of cover},

Although many of the Imams and people of lofty status, whom no one could accuse of lying, have reported seeing the Prophet, peace be upon him, in a wakeful state, the issue remains problematic for some Scholars, among both the supporters and the critics of the Sufis. Imam al-Suyuti argues that such a vision is not only possible, but that there are many well-documented examples of such visions, both in the time of the Sahabah (radhi Allahu 'anhum ajma'in) and afterwards. The Imam begins with texts that are irrefutable, from the Sunnah of the Prophet, peace be upon him, which establish the explicit possibility of the occurrence of such visions. Al-Suyuti then presents sound anecdotal evidence that such encounters have occurred in the past, mentioning stories from the Companions (radhi Allahu 'anhum ajma'in) and from the righteous Scholars and Imams (may Allah have mercy on them). Finally, Imam al-Suyuti concludes this short treatise by providing answers to various possible and plausible objections. Overall, this book is recommended as an introduction to the subject, which is covered in detail in the works of many of the Awliya' (may Allah have mercy on them).},

The solidarity of our community has always been strong and committed, particularly in times when the needs of the congregation were the greatest. We have always worked towards our mission of `welcoming home' all Muslims from all walks of life; to Care for Humanity, One Soul at a Time. With the current challenges of COVID-19, persisting as a congregation is more important now than ever. Your Masjid needs your help in this time of great strife. The Islamic Forum of Canada is asking you, as someone we hold to be part of our family, to support your Masjid -- your home, in a massive effort to help keep our lights on. We will appreciate your kindness by publicly recognizing your donation and our deepest gratitude on the Nightly YouTube Live streams and on all Islamic Forum of Canada social media channels. This time has proven to be challenging for our Masjid to subsist, especially with a loss of our foundational donation stream from every Friday Jumu'ah. We are asking that you help us keep the lights on for our Masjid during this time of great strife so that we can continue to serve you and others like you.  ** We have introduced a Financially Sustainable Model for the Masjid to cover the rising internet costs of Livestreaming every night. For only \$20/month you can support us. **  Please follow the link: https://islamicforumonline.com/monthl...},
