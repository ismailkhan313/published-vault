بِسْمِ اللهِ الرَّحْمٰنِ الرَّحِيْمِ

اَلْحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِيْنَ، وَالصَّلَاةُ وَالسَّلَامُ عَلَىٰ أَشْرَفِ الْأَنْبِيَاءِ وَالْمُرْسَلِيْنَ، سَيِّدِنَا مُحَمَّدٍ وَعَلَىٰ آلِهِ وَصَحْبِهِ أَجْمَعِيْنَ

As-salāmu ʿalaykum. This little online oasis is intended to be a shared journey of learning. It is a chronicle of study, a place for reflection, and an attempt to connect more deeply with the vast oceans of Islamic knowledge. Its purpose is to present notes, reflections, and analyses grounded in primary and secondary source material, with a specific focus on the discipline of _Taṣawwuf_ (Sufism) as the spiritual core of the Islamic tradition.

The oases of Paradise are named, they are the springs of Knowledge and Wisdom. “Indeed, the righteous will drink from a cup whose mixture is of Kāfūr, A spring from which the [righteous] servants of Allah will drink; they make it gush forth in abundance.” (Sūrah al-Insān, 76:5-6)

The Circles of Remembrance in this world are Oases of Paradise on Earth. It is narrated that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, “When you pass by the Gardens of Paradise, then feast.” They said, “And what are the Gardens of Paradise?” He said, "The circles of remembrance (_ḥalaq al-dhikr_).” (Jāmiʿ al-Tirmidhī)

Gatherings for beneficial knowledge are Oases of Mercy. “No people gather in one of the houses of Allah, reciting the Book of Allah and studying it among themselves, but that tranquility (_sakīnah_) descends upon them, mercy (_raḥmah_) envelops them, the angels surround them, and Allah mentions them to those who are with Him." (Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim)

This work is undertaken with the hope that it is preserved from error. All that is correct is from Allah, and any shortcoming is from myself.


وَمَا تَوْفِيقِي إِلَّا بِاللَّهِ
وَصَلَّى اللهُ عَلَى سَيِّدِنَا مُحَمَّدٍ وَعَلَى آلِهِ وَصَحْبِهِ وَسَلَّمَ
وَآخِرُ دَعْوَانَا أَنِ الْحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِيْنَ
