## Overview of Categorization

The Ḥanafī school of Islamic law categorizes the actions of morally responsible individuals into eight distinct rulings. While other legal schools generally agree on a main five-part classification of Sharīʿa rulings—Obligatory, Sunna, Permitted, Disliked, and Prohibited—the Ḥanafīs further refine these categories. This refinement stems from the observation that obligations and prohibitions can be established in one of two ways: "Through a decisive text (*dalīl qaṭʿī*)” or "Through a probabilistic text (*dalīl ẓannī*).” It is considered "undeniable that an obligation or prohibition established through a decisive text is more serious in its implications than that which is established through a probabilistic text." These distinctions were derived from a "detailed, careful study of the primary texts," as elaborated in more extensive works on the fundamentals of legal methodology (_uṣūl al-fiqh_).

## The Eight Rulings in Hanafi Fiqh

### 1. The Obligatory (fard)

- **Definition:** This refers to a firm command established by a decisively-established text. A decisively-established text is one whose meaning is decisive and not open to the possibility of interpretation. Examples of such texts include the entire _Qurʾān_, and those _ḥadīths_ related by multiple contiguous chains (_mutawātir_).
- **Implications:** One is bound to believe in and act on the obligatory. The individual who denies it could well fall into disbelief, and the one who leaves it is sinful.
- **Action Required:** It must be performed.

### 2. The Necessary (wajib)

- **Definition:** This is a firm command affirmed by a text that allows the possibility of interpretation.
- **Implications:** Denying something necessary is considered corruption (_fisq_) but not disbelief. Leaving it is sinful.
- **Application in Prayer:** Regarding necessary aspects of prayer, the prayer itself is not invalidated by their omission; however, it becomes necessary to repeat it if they were left out intentionally. If left out forgetfully, a forgetfulness prostration is necessary at the end of the prayer; if this too is left out, then it is necessary (_wājib_) to repeat the prayer.
- **Action Required:** It must be performed.

### 3. The Confirmed Sunna (sunna muʾakkada)

- **Definition:** This refers to that which our Prophet ﷺ or the Companions did most of the time (and was not of worldly habits). This is also known as the emphasized sunna.
- **Implications:** One who leaves it without excuse deserves reproach, not punishment. However, leaving it habitually is sinful, though, because it entails _turning away_ from the guidance of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, whom we have been commanded to follow.
- **Action Required:** It is strongly emphasized to perform the confirmed sunnas, and blameworthy to leave them without excuse.

### 4. The Recommended (mustahabb or mandub)

- **Definition:** This describes that which our Prophet ﷺ did sometimes. It also includes matters the Prophet did sometimes or by way of habit.
- **Implications:** The one who performs it is rewarded but one who does not is not worthy of reproach.
- **Action Required:** It should be performed.

### 5. The Permissible (mubah)

- **Definition:** This category entails neither reward nor punishment.
- **Implications:** Such acts are rewarded, however, if accompanied by a good intention. Furthermore, being wasteful in using the permitted is blameworthy and can even become sinful if excessive.
- **Action Required:** It should be conjoined with good intentions, to be worthy of reward, and one should avoid wastefulness.

### 6. The Somewhat Disliked (makruh tanzihan)

- **Definition:** This refers to that which we have been lightly commanded to leave.
- **Implications:** It is not sinful or blameworthy to do. There is reward in leaving it.
- **Action Required:** It **should** be left.

### 7. The Prohibitively Disliked (makruh tahriman)

- **Definition:** This is that which we have firmly commanded to leave, through a text open to the possibility of interpretation.
- **Implications:** Denying such a command entails misguidance but not disbelief. Performing such an action is sinful.
- **Action Required:** It **must** be left.

### 8. The Forbidden (haram)

- **Definition:** This signifies that which we have been firmly commanded to leave, through a decisively-established text. For instance, killing an innocent human is _ḥarām_.
- **Implications:** As an example, an innocent petty lie is also _ḥarām_, though one is immensely more grave than the other.
- **Action Required:** It **must** be left.

## Nuances in Classification and Derivation

### Basis for Hanafi Distinctions

The Ḥanafī school's detailed classifications stem from analyzing the strength and certainty of the textual evidence. They distinguish between commands and prohibitions based on whether they are established "through a decisive text" (*dalīl qaṭʿī*) or "through a probabilistic text (*dalīl ẓannī*)." The implications of actions based on decisive texts are considered more serious. These distinctions were derived from extensive scholarly work in fundamentals of legal methodology (_uṣūl al-fiqh_).

### Divisions of Obligations and Prohibitions

- **Obligations:** Based on the type of text, obligations are divided into the obligatory (_farḍ_) from a decisive text and the necessary (_wājib_) from a probabilistic text.
- **Prohibitions:** Similarly, prohibitions are divided into the prohibited (_ḥarām_) from a decisive text and the prohibitively disliked (_makrūh taḥrīman_) from a probabilistic text.

### Divisions of Sunna Acts

The _sunna_ of Prophet Muḥammad ﷺ is also further categorized:

- Matters that he strongly emphasized (or warned against leaving). These correspond to the emphasized sunna (_sunna muʾakkada_).
- Matters that he did sometimes or by way of habit. These are referred to as the recommended (_mustaḥabb_ or _mandūb_). The rulings related to each of these two levels of sunna acts differs, too, as described.

## General Principles and Guidance

The overall approach in Ḥanafī Fiqh emphasizes adherence to divine commands and prohibitions:

- "The obligatory and necessary must be performed."
- "The prohibitively disliked and forbidden must be left."
- It is "strongly emphasized to perform the confirmed sunnas, and blameworthy to leave them without excuse."
- "The recommended should be performed, and the somewhat disliked should be left."
- "The permitted should be conjoined with good intentions, to be worthy of reward, and one should avoid wastefulness."

The "way of love and slavehood entails doing everything one’s Lord commanded, whether firmly or lightly, and avoiding everything one’s Lord interdicted, whether firmly or lightly." However, the practical application of this is "best through a gradual and steady manner." As related by Abū Hurayra (Allah be pleased with him), the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: "Verily, this religion is easy, and no one makes their religion excessively difficult except that it overcomes them. So be moderate, do your best, and be of glad tidings." [Bukhārī (39), Muslim (2816)].

The explanations regarding Ḥanafī legal rulings draw from sources such as Ibn ʿĀbidīn's _Radd al-Muḥtār_ and ʿAlāʾ al-Dīn al-Bukhārī's _Kashf al-Asrār ʿalā Uṣūl al-Bazdawī_.
